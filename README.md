***"Want a break from the ads?"*** The free Spotify tier mocks to me. I'm too petty to pay for premium, so I decided to get my music offline and bypass Spotify altogether.
Spotify Playlist Downloader's end goal is to download a list of every song in a given playlist and download it using youtube-dl for offline listening. It's still early in development and probably won't be done for a while. Right now it can fetch a list of up to 100 songs in a playlist and (if set up with pathnames) write them all to a file.

**Edit:** Gave up (not worth my time and Spotify has wrapped) and decided to just reinstall cracked Spotify on iPhone every week. Checkout https://github.com/whoeevee/EeveeSpotify
